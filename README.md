One level of a breakout game.  Play will be able to move paddle back and forth using mouse. Ball will bounce off paddle and walls. When the ball collides with the tiles, they will disappear, giving the player points, as updated in the upper left hand corner. The player has 3 lives, and when the ball leaves the screen, they will lose a life. There is one level and a game over screen.

Tiles and paddle will bounce into screen once the game is ran.  Paddle will distort as the player moves it, with the eyes tracking the ball.  When the ball hits the paddle, confetti will appear.  When the ball hits any surface, a sound will play.  When the ball hits the walls or tiles, the screen will shake.
